# 🦈 PolyShark

> *"If markets contradict themselves, eat the contradiction."*

**PolyShark** is a paper-trading arbitrage bot for Polymarket that detects and exploits logical mispricing between linked prediction markets.

---

## 🎯 What It Does

- Uses a **simulated USDC wallet** (starting at `$1,000`)
- Simulates **linked markets** with realistic price drift
- Detects **logical arbitrage opportunities** (e.g., when YES + NO ≠ 1)
- Executes **buy + sell** pairs to capture the spread
- Waits for **mean reversion** before closing positions
- Tracks **realistic PnL** with fees, slippage, and execution costs

## 🧠 Architecture

```
wallet.rs        → USDC wallet & position tracking
market.rs        → Market simulation + price drift
constraint.rs    → Logical relationships (A + B = 1, etc.)
arb.rs           → Arbitrage detection & signal logic
engine.rs        → Main trading loop
```

## 📊 What to Expect

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Equity fluctuation | Normal — reflects market noise |
| Small wins | Most trades capture modest spreads |
| Rare drawdowns | Expected from adverse moves |
| Mean reversion | Clear profit when prices correct |
| Logic breaks | Easily visible when constraints are violated |

---

## 🔧 Execution Realism

PolyShark models **real execution dynamics**:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Fees** | Taker/maker fees applied per trade |
| **Slippage** | Non-linear price impact based on order size |
| **Partial Fills** | Orders may not fully execute |
| **Latency** | Delay between signal and execution |
| **Position Sizing** | Dynamic sizing based on risk & liquidity |

---

## 🚀 Upgrade Path

| Paper Bot | Solana Version |
|-----------|----------------|
| `Wallet.usdc` | SPL Token balance |
| `Market.price` | On-chain price oracle |
| `try_arbitrage()` | Atomic transaction |
| `try_close()` | Exit transaction |
